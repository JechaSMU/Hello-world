# Hello-world
My first repository

Hi everybody,

I'm leaning github.  Taking a course in data science at SMU which has me totally confused and pretty much taking any free hours I have. If only I don't need to sleep.  I spend so much time sitting at my computer.  Now I understand the other guys when they said get a comfortable chair and don't worry so much on the grade, it's about getting through it. 

Well, here's hoping that things will get better!
